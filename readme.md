# Rust 

Starting with rust as a side project because I am working for a web 3 project.
So, i need to learn Rust for that purpose.

I will be sharing all the content and rust projects in [Rust](https://github.com/sujalxverma/Rust.git) git repository.

Feel free to use and fork.

## Compiling
```terminal
biuld : cargo build
directly run : cargo run
